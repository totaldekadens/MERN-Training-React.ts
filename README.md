# MERN Training - Soccer Management

This project is based on LinkedinLearning: MERN Essential Training (2020) by Emmanuel Henri.

Languages/Frameworks/Libraries the project touches:

* Mongoose (MongoDB)
* Express
* React.ts
* Node.js
* Materialize

The project he did during the training left me with some development opportunities (mainly client side). So that is what I will continue with here.

To do:

* Convert from JavaScript to TypeScript ✅ (few "any´s left)
* Convert all class-components to functional components. ✅
* Change axios to fetch. ✅
* Make it possible to delete player (client) ✅
* Make it possible to update player (client) ✅
* Add form validation (client side - simple) ✅
* Add form validation (server side - simple) 
* Add User Authentication with JWT (ref. bezKoder) ✅
* Add signin and signup form and connect it with server side
* Complete the form so it matches the player model (Schema) incl. validation.
* Make it possible to add and change pic on player. 
* Design/Styling (incl responsivity). Change from Materialize to MUI?
